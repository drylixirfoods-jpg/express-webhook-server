## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/express-webhook-server.git
   ```

3. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/drylixirfoods-jpg/express-webhook-server.git
   ```

4. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Make your changes and test them:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Start with a type: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test

Example:
```
feat: add rate limiting to webhook endpoint

Implement basic rate limiting using express middleware
with configurable window and max requests per window.

Fixes #123
```

### JavaScript Styleguide

* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use const for constants and let for variables (avoid var)
* Use async/await instead of .then() when possible
* Use arrow functions for callbacks
* Comment complex logic
* Use meaningful variable names

Example:
```javascript
// Good
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

// Bad
var exp = require('express');
var a = exp();
var b = require('body-parser');
a.use(b.json());
a.get('/',(q,r)=>{r.send('Hello World')});
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use Markdown
* Reference other sections with markdown links
* Include code examples where appropriate
* Use proper grammar and spelling

## Additional Notes
